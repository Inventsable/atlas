## transfer:

* ~~Modifier and key events~~
* Grid
* Crosshair
* Ghostmarker
* Mini-map

## rebuild:

* Guarantee CSS @keyframes animation for all SVG elements.
* Guarantee popover elements and distinct popover form
* Debug Mode
* Session data for current active map
* 16:9 ratio: adjustable grid (8), dragbar (1), text-info section (7); each responsive
* Hover status: Needs more reliable area detection
* Handle Proper names only -- verify data.
* Waters/bounds: Needs to be component similar to cities
* Redo all :style/:class/:mouseovers/:mouseouts
* Texter component needs rework for annotation/note components
* Simple markers should share component
* Streamline CSS variables
* Replace areas with regions, double up on coasts when need be and render bodies separately
* Add component for shores/oceans
* Add route components for streets and rivers
* Places (landmarks) should expand to full-size of affect area on mouseover -- alternatively places should be rectangles that fade out on hover and activate the region instead
* Should have foresight about geographical and aesthetic layers

## create compatible Illustrator plugin (gaia) to export ready-made svg snippets instead of manually editing them
